# GyrfalconPtarmigan_MAR
Multivariate autoregressive models applied to gyrfalcon - ptarmigan count time series data.
Joint project with Olafur Nielsen. 

* MAR models allow to highlight the interactions between the two species dynamics
* Using weather data from NE Iceland to infer weather effects on population growth 
* Two different time lags considered to allow cyclic dynamics to occur independently of the predator-prey feedback
* Two key models, one with predator-prey feedback and one with bottom-up dynamics are considered in detail
* Models are compared both in terms of fit and from the simulated dynamics they produce
